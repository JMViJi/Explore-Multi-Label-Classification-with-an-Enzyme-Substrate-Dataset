# Multi-Label Classification with an Enzyme Substrate 

## Introduction
The study of enzymes, specialized proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions, is crucial for understanding the mechanisms behind many biological processes. One of the most challenging tasks in bioinformatics is to predict the enzymes acting on a specific substrate from sequence or structure data. In this Kaggle competition, we tackle the problem of multi-label classification of enzyme substrates from a dataset of molecular features.

### Problem Summary
In this Kaggle competition, the primary task is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting the classifications of enzymes, specifically EC1 and EC2. These are not simply classifications, but rather represent specific types of enzymes that interact with substrates in unique ways. Our predictions will be made for each identifier in the test set, based on a collection of molecular features.

To understand this task more profoundly, it's important to grasp the biological basis behind it. Enzymes are specialized proteins that accelerate chemical reactions within organisms. For instance, specific enzymes in your stomach aid in breaking down ingested food into smaller, usable components for your body.

A crucial characteristic of enzymes is that they interact with particular substrates in a manner reminiscent of a key fitting into a lock. In this analogy, the enzyme represents the key, while the substrate represents the lock. Intriguingly, this interaction isn't exclusive â€” one type of enzyme can interact with multiple substrates, and a single substrate can be acted upon by several enzymes.

This unique many-to-many interaction brings about the main challenge of this competition. We are tasked to predict which type of enzyme, either EC1 or EC2, will interact with a substrate based on the substrate's specific features. In essence, our model should determine the "correct key" for each "lock" by examining the properties of the lock.

The complexity of this task arises from the need to predict multiple "keys" for each "lock", a situation that defines this as a multi-label classification problem.

As for the evaluation of submissions, the primary metric utilized is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC). This metric measures how well your model can distinguish between different types of enzymes. Your model's predictions will be compared to the actual classifications, with the final score being the average AUC of each predicted column. This offers a balanced view of the model's performance across the different targets.

### Methodology
The problem posed in this competition is a multi-label classification problem. Given the feature set provided, the methodological approach will involve the use of machine learning and/or deep learning techniques to build a model that is capable of predicting the EC1 and EC2 targets. As the model's performance is evaluated based on AUC-ROC, the methodology will also need to include strategies to maximize this metric. Lastly, as the problem involves predicting multiple labels, it may be useful to consider approaches specific to multi-label classification, such as chain classifiers or problem transformation methods.
